# Variables
A **variable** is a container for data
  * The data can be read and changed at any time
**Variables** provide means for:
  * **Storing** data
  * **Retrieving** stored data
  * **Modifying** stored data
  
Variables are characterized by:
  * name (identifier)
  * type (of the information preserved)
  * value (stored information)
```csharp
int age = 25;
```
Variable == named area of the computer memory
  * Stores a value of a particular data type
  * Accessible in the program by name
Can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - in the execution stack
  * Dynamic memory - in the heap
